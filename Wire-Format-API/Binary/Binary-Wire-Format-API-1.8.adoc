=== Goals

The Binary Wire Format API is a binary one to one translation of the Text format.

WFA is designed to be high level description for Wire Formats to comply with.  Any Wire Format which complies with this RFC can be accessed through the same API.

This format should be automatically translatable to the Text (human readable) format.

=== Encoding Byte

For short fields, the first byte denotes the type of the field, for small numbers the value is encoded in the later 4 bits. For strings and fields the later 4 bits denote the length of the preceeding data. For large numerics or string/fields the special type is used see section below :

| top three bits denotes a three Type   | x   | x   | x   |  x  |     |     |     |
| remaining bits denotes the size/value |     |     |     |     | x   | x  |  x   | x

==== Definition of a field and a string

In the following uri

[source, yaml]
csp: //a-uri?view=map

'csp' is the Field.

And '//a-uri?view=map' is the String

=== Types / Control Messages ( for larger values )

the types use the Control Messages

Version 1.6 added 0xBD

===  Delta Wire

Version 1.8 added 

Delta Wire is a compact form of binary wire, in fact its not a separate wire format at all, delta wire just makes use of some additional control codes that are available in the binary wire format. As such, not all messages have to make use of the delta wire control codes, so its possible to mix between using delta wire and binary wire with in the same payload. We refer to a message being "send via delta wire" when it is in fact a binarry wire message that is using these delta wire control code. DeltaWire introduces 4 addional code, see below: 

[options="header"]
|===
| Code                     | Used for 
| (0x87) - Field Anchor                | Setting Field
| (0x88) - Anchor                       | Reading Field
| (0xBA) - Field Number stop bit encoded | Setting  Value 
| (0x89 ) Updated Alias | Reading/modifying existing Value
|===

==== Field Cache

The following covers field caching, the first time a field is sent a token is sent along with the field name, subsequent updates of this field will refer to the field via the field token (stopbit encoded), it wont again send the field.

Assume we have the following message :

[source]
{hello: 1}

in Binary Wire this would encode to:

[source]
C5 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01

[options="header"]
|===
|hex | description
| 0xC5 | Field of Len 5
| 0x68 | ‘h’ as Ascii
| 0x65 | ‘e’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6F | ‘o’ as Ascii
| 0x01 | value of 1
|===

in Delta Wire this becomes:

[source]
87 00 05 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01

|===
| 0x87 | field anchor - special code to denote the next byte is a field token
| 0x00 | field token - assign 0='hello'
| 0x05 | field len
| 0x68 | ‘h’ as Ascii
| 0x65 | ‘e’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6F | ‘o’ as Ascii
| 0x01 | value of 1
|===

If the same field is sent repeatedly, delta wire is a more compact format than Binary Wire, so the following :

[source]
{
	hello: 1,
	hello: 1,
	hello: 1
}

becomes -  in Binary Wire:

[source]
C5 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01 C5 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01 C5 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01

and in Delta Wire :

[source]
87 00 05 68 65 6C 6C 6F  01 BA 00 01 BA 00 01

[options="header"]
|===
|hex | description
| 0x87 | field anchor -  special code to denote the next byte is a field token
| 0x00 | field token (stopbit encoded)- assign 0='hello'
| 0x05 | field length
| 0x68 | ‘h’ as Ascii
| 0x65 | ‘e’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6F | ‘o’ as Ascii
| 0xBA | Field Number  - special code to denote the next byte is a field token
| 0x00 | field token (stopbit encoded), 0='hello'
| 0x01 | value of 1
| 0xBA | Field Number  - special code to denote the next byte is a field token
| 0x00 | field token (stopbit encoded), 0='hello'
| 0x01 | value of 1
|===

==== Field Token Cache

When a messages sent with a 'Field Anchor', we should always cache the relationship between the field token and its field.

So when the following delta binary is received :

87 00 05 68 65 6C 6C 6F

we cache the following relationship

.field token cache
[options="header"]
|===
| field token  | field
| 0   | hello
|===

each field is allocated a token, there is always a one to one relationship between the tokens and fields.

so if the following binary was received :

[source]
87 00 05 68 65 6C 6C 6F 01 87 01 05 77 6F 72 6C 64 01

then we would cache

.field token cache
[options="header"]
|===
| field token  | field
| 0   | hello
| 1   | world
|===

==== Overwriting of the Field Anchor

Field tokens can be reused, so if we then subsequently receive

[source]
87 01 08 75 6E 69 76 65  72 73 65 01

.field token cache
|===
| field token   | field
| 0   | hello
| 1   | universe
|===

we overwrite the existing cache entry  1='world' and replace it with 1='universe'

It we subsequently receive a message that sets field token 1 to the value of 2, like below :

[source]
BA 01 02

then this is sets the field universe to the value of 2

[source]
{universe:2}

rather than

[source]
{world:2}

for this reason it's important that all DELTA wire messages are read in order and no messages are skipped.
As such, There is a separtate instance of this field token cache per TCP/IP socket connection.

== Delta Wire Values

=== Non Typed Object Values

if we write a simple non typed object ( like the message below ), then only the keys are cached, we conver the deltaing of non typed objects in more detail in this section.

[source]
hello: {
  f1: hello,
  f2: world
}

in binary wire ( formatted into blocks of 8 bytes for better readablity )

[source]
C5 68 65 6C 6C 6F 82 12
00 00 00 C2 66 31 E5 68
65 6C 6C 6F C2 66 32 E5
77 6F 72 6C 64

in delta wire

[source]
87 00 05 68 65 6C 6C 6F
82 16 00 00 00 87 01 02
66 31 E5 68 65 6C 6C 6F
87 02 02 66 32 E5 77 6F
72 6C 64

in delta wire this decodes to :

[options="header"]
|===
|hex | description
| 0x87 | field anchor
| 0x00 | field token (stopbit encoded) - assign 0='hello'
| 0x05 | field length
| 0x68 | ‘h’ as Ascii
| 0x65 | ‘e’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6C | ‘l’ as Ascii
| 0x6F | ‘o’ as Ascii
| |
| 0x82 | Nested Block 32bit len
| 0x16, 0x00,0x00,0x00 | 4 byte len=22
| 0xBA | field number  - special message to denote the next value is a field token
| 0x87 | field anchor
| 0x01 | field token (stopbit encoded) - assigns 1='f1'
| 0x02 | field len=2 of 'f1'
| |
| 0x66 | 'f' as Ascii
| 0x31 | '1' as Ascii
| 0xE5 | String of len=5  ( from 'hello' )
| 0x68 | 'h' as Ascii
| 0x65 | 'e' as Ascii
| 0x6C | 'l' as Ascii
| 0x6C | 'l' as Ascii
| 0x6F | 'o' as Ascii
| |
| 0x87 | field anchor
| 0x02 | field token (stopbit encoded) - assigns 2='f2'
| 0x02 | field len=2 of 'f3'
| 0x66 | 'f' as Ascii
| 0x32 | '2' as Ascii
| 0xE5 | String of len=5 ( from  'world' )
| 0x77 | 'w' as Ascii
| 0x6F | 'o' as Ascii
| |
| 0x72 | 'r' as Ascii
| 0x6C | 'l' as Ascii
| 0x64 | 'd' as Ascii
|===

=== Typed Object Values

When using typed object we able able to apply full deltaing for the values, this is unlike the example above which just tokenizes the field names. In this example you will see the user of the (0x88) anchor tag, it works in conjunction with (0x89) Updated Alias which is used for reading the anchors. see table below :

|===
| hex | name | descirption
| 0x88 | Anchor  | used to set the Anchor in the anchor cache
| 0x89 | Updated Alias  | read/use the anchor from the anchor cache, This is also used when a field is being re-assinged a new value with a data structure, see example below on "Changing just a single field"
|===

This anchor cache works exactly like the "field token cache" descibed above, it also has its own cache per tcp/ip connection.

If send a typed message, for example a message of type "!MyType" then we are also going to send an (0x88) anchor tag as well as a ( 0x87) field anchor as we did in the section on "non typed object values" above.

because we have used the 0x88 anchor tag this means if we send the

[source]
hello: !MyType {
  f1: hello,
  f2: world
}

message again ( for a second time ) then we only have to send:

BA 00 89 00

==== Changing just a single field

If we were to resend the message again, but this time changed, the field f2 from 'world' to 'universe'

[source]
hello: !MyType {
  f1: hello,
  f2: universe
}

then only the change to the f2 field is sent

===  Sequences, Maps and Marshallables

the sequence area encoded using

[source]
0x82 <four byte unsigned len, this is the length in bytes of the encoded block of preceding data>

so if we were going to encode these simple 4 entries  shown below in text yaml )

[source]
{a,b,c,de}

As binary wire this would encode to

[source]
0x82 0x09 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xE1 0x61 0xE1 0x62 0xE1 0x63 0xE2 0x64 0x65

|===
| byte | description
| 0x82 | denoting a nested structure
| 0x09 0x00 0x00 0x00 | the number of bytes of data to follow ( in little endian )
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1
| 0x61 | 'a'
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1
| 0x62 | 'b'
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1
| 0x63 | 'c'
| 0xE2 | next element is a string of len 2
| 0x64 0x65 | 'de'
|===

[NOTE]
Although YAML treats sequences and maps differently, for binary wire we use similar encoding, its just they will hold different information

[source, yaml]
{f1: a, f2: de}

as binary wire this would encode to

[source]
0x82 0x0B 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xC2 0x66 0x31 0xE1 0x62 0xC2 0x66 0x32 0xE2 0x64 0x65

|===
| byte | description
| 0x82 | denoting a nested structure
| 0x0B 0x00 0x00 0x00 | the number of bytes of data to follow ( in little endian )
| 0xC2 |  next element is a field of len 2
| 0x66 0x31 | 'f1'
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1
| 0x62 | 'b'

| 0x66 0x32 | 'f2'

== Example

using this encoding described above, the following YAML

[source, yaml]
----
--- !!meta-data
csp: //path/service
tid: 123456789
--- !!data
entrySet: [
    {
    key: key-1,
    value: value-1
},
    {
    key: key-2,
    value: value-2
}
]
----

When encoded with BinaryWire would appear as:

this is the java code that created this this binary output above

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testSequence() {
    Wire wire = createWire();
    writeMessage(wire);
    wire.flip();
    System.out.println(wire.bytes().toHexString());

    Wire twire = new TextWire(Bytes.elasticByteBuffer());
    writeMessage(twire);
    twire.flip();
    System.out.println(Wires.fromSizePrefixedBlobs(twire.bytes()));
}

private void writeMessage(Wire wire) {
    wire.writeDocument(true, w -> w
            .write("csp").text("//path/service")
            .write("tid").int64(123456789));
    wire.writeDocument(false, w -> w
            .write("entrySet").sequence(s -> {
                s.marshallable(m -> m
                        .write("key").text("key-1")
                        .write("value").text("value-1"));
                s.marshallable(m -> m
                        .write("key").text("key-2")
                        .write("value").text("value-2"));
            }));
}
----

=== Layout

The expected format is

- 4 bytes length with the meta-data bit set.
- 3-byte field + "csp"
- N-byte string + string
- 3-bytes field + "tid"
- integer value as a int64.

In the future we will make the tid to be smaller. possibly just a byte or 3 (uint16).

Q.Where would the nested be involved?

A.You might consider the whole document with its length a "nested" structure.
