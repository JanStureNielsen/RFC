== Goals
A measure to ensure a decentralised ledger doesn't gravitate to
a small number of providers in a small number of regions.

=== Proof of IP
This strategy records the proof that a server is verified by a range of IP addresses.

This verified address can be used to ensure fairness across the internet
and give little incentive to one provider running up tens of thousands of servers.
